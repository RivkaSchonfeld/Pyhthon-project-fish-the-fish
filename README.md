# 🎣 Fish the Fish – Console Game

Welcome to **Fish the Fish**, a console-based Python game where you play as a fisherman trying to locate a hidden fish in a grid. Each guess gives you a distance clue, and if you're stuck, you can ask for a directional hint. The fewer steps you take, the higher your score!
